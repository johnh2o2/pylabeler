Provides simple GUI interface for classification/labeling tasks

Installing
----------

* Do `python setup.py install`

Using
-----

* The `test` directory contains a simple example

* You need 
	1. set of image(s) for each object you want to classify
	2. set of labels/classes
	3. a file to save/load the classification results to/from

* Do the following in your script:
	* from pylabeler.labeler import Labeler
	* lblr = Labeler(image_files, label_file, classes, keyboard_shortcuts)
		* image_files is a dict { ID1 : [ imagefile1, imagefile2, ... ], ID2 : ... }
		* label_file is the name of the file that you save/load labels to/from
		* classes are a list of available labels/classes
	* lblr.connect()
	* plt.show()

Notes
-----

* This was designed for personal use, so it's quite simple without many bells+whistles
